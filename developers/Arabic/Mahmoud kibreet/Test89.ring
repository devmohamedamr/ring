	(1) Communction between objects (Only using Mesages)
	(2) Object (Data + Methods) - Separate Data
	[	State is the evil	]

	Data   ----> (you need to prodect)
	Method ----> (Your way to get the Data)

      *	Class (Definition) = Attributes - Data - Methods
	----> Many Objects
	[Class Based OOP] --- Java C# C++ Ring Ruby Python

      * Objects (Properties - Values) - Copy Object
	[Prototype Based OOP] --- Self JavaScript

      * Poly.---> Same Interface (Methods) ---> For different objs 
		execute() ---> SQLite
		execute() ---> MySQL


      * Inheritance
		Child ---> Parents
					Humans
					Employee
					Engineers

     * Composition (Object - Contains other objects)
	Rectangle (2 object (Point))
